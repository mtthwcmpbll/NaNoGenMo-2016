      " _The_ Dunwich Horror  by H. P. LOVECRAFT   \"Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras--dire stories of CelÃ¦no and the Harpies--may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition--_but they were there before_.\n",

      "\n",
      "Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, least of all!\n",
      "\n",
      "_These terrors are of older standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "They date beyond body_--or without the body, they would have been the same.... That the kind of fear here treated is purely spiritual--that it is strong in proportion as it is objectless on earth, that it predominates in the period of our sinless infancy--are difficulties\n",

      "\n",
      "The ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty, curving road.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprizing uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or in the sloping, rock-strewn meadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be better to have nothing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bullfrogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic's upper reaches has an oddly serpentlike suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighboring region.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church now harbors the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "One dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odor about the village street, as of the massed mold and decay of centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is always a relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scenery, judged by any ordinary esthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our sensible age--since the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town's and the world's welfare at heart--people shun it without knowing exactly why.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps one reason--though it can not apply to uninformed strangers--is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England backwaters.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average of their intelligence is wofully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which came from Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and Miskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the moldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were born.  \n",
      "\n",
      "No one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror, can say just what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps, in which he said:  It must be allow'd that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of DÃ¦mons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny'd; the cursed Voices of _Azazel_ and _Buzrael_, of _Beelzebub_ and _Belial_, being heard from under Ground by above a Score of credible Witnesses now living.\n",
      "\n",
      "I myself did not more than a Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the Hill behind my House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth cou'd raise up, and which must needs have come from those Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the text, printed in Springfield, is still extant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Other traditions tell of foul odors near the hill-crowning circles of stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines; while still others try to explain the Devil's Hop Yard--a bleak, blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, too, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they time their eery cries in unison with the sufferer's struggling breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in demoniac laughter; but if they fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come down from very old times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old--older by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "South of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient Bishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry did not flourish here, and the Nineteenth Century factory movement proved short-lived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oldest of all are the great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops, but these are more generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deposits of skulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizable table-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many ethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory, persist in believing the remains Caucasian.   2  \n",
      "\n",
      "It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5 a. m. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913.\n",
      "\n",
      "This date was recalled because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe under another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded, and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout the night before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of 35, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might--and did--speculate as widely as they chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and worm-holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old Whateley's reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and singular occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs' barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neighbors knew nothing of him till a week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at Osborn's general store.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be a change in the old man--an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear--though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amidst it all he showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and what he said of the child's paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I dun't keer what folks think--ef Lavinny's boy looked like his pa\n",
      "\n",
      ", he wouldn't look like nothin' ye expeck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ye needn't think the only folks is the folks hereabouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lavinny's read some, an' has seed some things the most o' ye only tell abaout.\n",
      "\n",
      "I calc'late her man is as good a husban' as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an' ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn't ast no better church weddin' nor her'n.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell ye suthin'--_some day yew folks'll hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel Hill!_\"  The only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer's common-law wife, Mamie Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mamie's visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his son Curtis.\n",
      "\n",
      "This marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur's family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did the ramshackle Whateley barn seem over-crowded with livestock.\n",
      "\n",
      "There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anemic, bloodless-looking specimens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the gray, unshaven old man and his slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the spring after Wilbur's birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilbur's growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age.\n",
      "\n",
      "His motions and even his vocal sounds showed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It was somewhat after this time--on Hallowe'en--that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop--of the undecayed Bishops--mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silas was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern.\n",
      "\n",
      "They darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterward he could not be sure about the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark blue trunks or trousers on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that \"Lavinny's black brat\" had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months.\n",
      "\n",
      "His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother's and grandfather's chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression on his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of _Yog-Sothoth_ in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dogs abhorred the boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace.   3  Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house--a spacious, peaked-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labor; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry seemed to show the effects of sound calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had really begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no less thorough craftsman.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mania showed itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section--though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Less inexplicable was his fitting-up of another downstairs room for his new grandson--a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted to the closely-boarded upper story.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chamber he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I made some use of 'em,\" he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, \"but the boy's fitten to make better use of 'em.\n",
      "\n",
      "He'd orter hev 'em as well sot as he kin for they're goin' to be all of his larnin'.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "When Wilbur was a year and seven months old--in September of 1914--his size and accomplishments were almost alarming.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings.\n",
      "\n",
      "At home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather's books, while Old Whateley would instruct and catechize him through long, hushed afternoons.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the period of this work's completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur's birth, had been abandoned again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odor he encountered--such a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May Eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the following Hallowe'en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronized with bursts of flame--\"them witch Whateleys' doin's\"--from the summit of Sentinel Hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilbur was growing up uncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year.\n",
      "\n",
      "He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than formerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "His occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardians.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second story.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading to the stairway.\n",
      "\n",
      "That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich Village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above.\n",
      "\n",
      "The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they shuddered as they recalled tales of Old Whateley's youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government, alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and medical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may still recall.\n",

He interspersed his study of the books with attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated.\n",

      "\n",
      "The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altarlike stone on the summit.  \n",

      "He hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped.\n",
      "\n",

      "They shook their heads at the visitors' plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near the glen; and as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold Spring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable fetor to the heavy night air; such a fetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before, when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being.\n",
